# UED-for-Mood-Training
This code represents the implementation of the Unsupervised Environment Design paradigm for Mood Training. During my Master's thesis, I conducted a comprehensive investigation into the confluence of Psychology and Multi-agent Machine Learning, with a particular focus on addressing the maze-solving problem.

Within this context, I discerned correlations between agent parameters and human psychological traits, notably associating "depression" with diminished interest in low-reward tasks and "anxiety" with an elevated perception of loss aversion. To quantify "depression" and "anxiety" scores, I strategically positioned the trained agents at predefined locations within mazes and computed their corresponding Q-Values.

To facilitate learning, I devised an "auto-curricula" strategy to progressively train agents on mazes of escalating complexity, all in pursuit of mitigating the "depression" and "anxiety" levels exhibited by these agents. The overarching objective was to identify parallels that could inform the automation of therapeutic games for humans combating these mental health challenges.
