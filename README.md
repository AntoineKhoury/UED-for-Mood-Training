# UED-for-Mood-Training
This code implemented the concept of Unsupervised Environement Design for Mood Training.
In my Master's thesis, I studied the intersection of Psychology and Multi-agent machine learning.
The support of my study was on the maze solving problem.

I found interpretations of agent parameters in human psychological traits, namely "depression" being a lack of interest in a doing a task with low reward and 
"anxiety" being an over perception of fear of loss.
To compute the "depression" and "anxiety" scores, I positioned the trained agents in certain defined maze positions and computed their Q-Values.
I created an "auto-curricula" to train agents on increasing difficulty mazes, and see if we could treat the "depression" and "anxiety" of those agents.

The interest was to draw parallels with how to automate games for humans to combat these diseases.
