# 🧠 Unsupervised Environment Design for Mood Training

This repository houses the codebase for the implementation of the Unsupervised Environment Design paradigm, a groundbreaking approach used during my Master's thesis to intertwine the worlds of Psychology and Multi-agent Machine Learning.


## 🎯 Project Aim

Through this exploration, I delved deep into the maze-solving challenge and discovered significant correlations:

- **Depression**: An agent showing reduced enthusiasm for low-reward tasks mirrored symptoms of human depression.
- **Anxiety**: Agents exhibiting a heightened sense of loss aversion drew parallels with human anxiety traits.

## 🔍 Methodology

To objectively measure "depression" and "anxiety" scores among agents:
1. I placed trained agents strategically across various maze locations.
2. Analyzed the corresponding Q-Values for each position.

## 🚀 Auto-Curricula for Enhanced Learning

Recognizing the implications, I introduced an "auto-curricula" strategy. This systematic approach:
- Began with simpler mazes.
- Gradually increased the complexity, training agents to adapt.
- Aimed to decrease exhibited "depression" and "anxiety" levels in agents.

## 🌟 The Ultimate Goal

Beyond just a machine learning exploration, this endeavor sought to unearth insights with real-world implications. The hope is to leverage these findings in creating automated therapeutic games — a beacon of support for individuals grappling with mental health challenges.
